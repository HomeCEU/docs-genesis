## Use Cases
- [Add SCO to course]
- [Generate proxy files for company]
- [External LMS needs course detail and proxy sco files]
- [SCORM course enrollment]
- [Consume SCORM content]
- [Record completions]
- [Download Certificate of Completion (COC)]

## Notes
- Generate proxy files for company
  - if the proxy sco file link from rusitci is open we can store their link rather than downloading the proxy sco file our self, in which case the additional table and separate process won't be nessicary.
